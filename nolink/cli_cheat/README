1.  What is this?

    'cheat' is a cheat-sheet script for people who are too impatient to browse
    the manual page for a given program.  It's well-suited for those who might
    use a program only occasionally, and need only brief reminders on the
    'important bits'; the cliff-notes version of man pages, if you will.

    This particular version, written as a Bash script, is a reimplementation of
    a Python script originally written by Chris Lane.  The other version is the
    'main' version; this is the off-shoot.


2.  How do I use it?

    Using this script is straightforward enough, in the typical UNIX/Linux
    fashion:

    cheat [OPTION] FILE[S]

    Options:
        -a or --add:        Add a text file to the cheat sheet directory
        -A:                 Add and compress (gzip) a text file
        -e or --edit:       Edit a cheat sheet, using editor in $EDITOR variable
        -k, -l or --list:   Grep for a keyword or list all available
        -h or --help:       List the help
        --version:          List version and author info


    Examples:

        cheat tar:          Display the cheat sheet for tar
        cheat -k:           List all available cheat sheets (in ~/.cheat)
        cheat -k tar:       Grep for all cheat sheets with 'tar' in the filename
        cheat -k tar sh:    Grep for sheets with 'tar' or 'sh' in filenames
        cheat -a foo:       Add 'foo' to the cheat sheet directory
        cheat -a foo bar:   Add both 'foo' and 'bar' to the cheat sheet dir
        cheat -A *.txt:     Add and compress all .txt files in current dir


    By default (and as of this version, there is no option to change this), all
    files added to the cheat sheet directory must be plain text files.  If they
    end with the extension .txt, that will be stripped from the filename.
