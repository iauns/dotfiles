# Non-global modules that aren't used on the command line should be installed by
# the packages that use the modules. This is because the packages then select
# the appropriate version of the modules to install. No more versioning BS that
# we run into with all of the other package managers.

# We do install the following packages due to commands that I haven't moved into
# their own repositories. These packages mostly reside in my dotfiles repo.
