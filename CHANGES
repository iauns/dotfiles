2013-08-11  0.8     Initial release

2013-08-12  0.9     Script no longer compresses files added with -a/--add.  It
                    still lists and reads compressed (.gz) files as before.

2013-08-16  0.91    Added an option (-A) to compress as before, though the
                    script still doesn't compress by default.

2013-08-22  0.95    Added the -e / --edit option to edit cheat sheets.  Idea
                    borrowed from user evaryont (https://github.com/evaryont)
